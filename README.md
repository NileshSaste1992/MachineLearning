Thanks for visiting!

Please have a look on regularly used machine learning algorithms with code examples. It covers most of the algorithms applied on various datasets. The use of datasets is only for demonstration purpose leading better understanding of machine learning. :)

The repository includes:

* KMeans Clustering

* K-Fold Cross Validation

* K Nearest Neighbours

* Decision Tree and Random Forest

* Principle Component Analysis

* Support Vector Machine

* XGBoost

* Naive Bay's

* User based collaborative filtering

* Item based collaborative filtering

* Tensorflow- Deep learning
